/**
 * @file The main entry point for the @messagejs/shared-types package.

 * This file serves as the public API for the shared types, re-exporting
 * all the necessary type definitions from the other modules in this package.
 * This allows other packages in the monorepo to import everything from a
 * single, consistent entry point.
 *
 * @example
 * import { User, SendMessageRequest, IConnector } from '@messagejs/shared-types';
