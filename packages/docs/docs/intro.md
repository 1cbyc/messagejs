# Welcome to MessageJS

MessageJS enables web developers to send messages via multiple chat platforms (WhatsApp, Telegram, SMS, etc.) through a simple SDK, without exposing credentials.

## What is MessageJS?

MessageJS is like SendGrid/EmailJS, but for chat applications. It provides:

- **Simple SDK**: Similar to EmailJS API (`init()` + `send()`)
- **Secure**: Credentials never exposed to frontend
- **Unified Interface**: Single API for multiple messaging platforms
- **Developer-Friendly**: Minimal setup, clear documentation

## Getting Started

## Architecture

MessageJS consists of:

- **Core**: Node.js/Express backend API
- **Client SDK**: Lightweight TypeScript SDK for browsers
- **Dashboard**: React/Next.js web UI for management
