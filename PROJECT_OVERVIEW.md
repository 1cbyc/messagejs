### 🏗️ PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Name:** `MessageJS`
**Goal:** A developer tool like *EmailJS*, but for chat-based platforms (WhatsApp, Telegram, SMS, etc.).

It provides a simple SDK (`messagejs-client`) and a backend API (`messagejs-core`) that lets web apps send messages securely without exposing credentials.

### ⚙️ CORE ARCHITECTURE

**Frontend (SDK)** → **Backend API (Node/Express)** → **Messaging Connectors** → **Third-party APIs**

#### Components:

| Component   | Description                                                                                                                              |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `core`      | Node.js/Express backend that manages API keys, projects, and message sending via connectors (WhatsApp Cloud API, Telegram Bot API, etc.) |
| `client`    | TypeScript SDK for frontend developers. Provides `init()` and `send()` similar to EmailJS.                                               |
| `dashboard` | React-based web UI for managing API keys, message templates, and viewing logs.                                                           |
| `docs`      | Docusaurus documentation website for users and contributors.                                                                             |
| `examples`  | Sample projects showing how to integrate MessageJS with different frameworks.                                                            |

---

### 🧩 CONNECTORS

Each messaging platform has its own connector module inside `/packages/core/src/connectors/`.

Uniform interface:

```js
connector.sendMessage(to, message, options)
```

Example connectors:

* WhatsApp (Meta Cloud API)
* Telegram
* Twilio (SMS)

### 🧰 STACK

| Layer     | Technology                  |
| --------- | --------------------------- |
| Backend   | Node.js + Express           |
| Database  | MongoDB or PostgreSQL       |
| Auth      | JWT + API key system        |
| SDK       | TypeScript + Rollup         |
| Dashboard | React (Next.js optional)    |
| Docs      | Docusaurus                  |
| Monorepo  | npm workspaces or Turborepo |

---

### 🛡️ SECURITY

* API keys are required for SDK calls
* JWT for user login
* Rate limiting per key
* Encrypted service tokens in DB

---

### 🧱 MONOREPO STRUCTURE

```
messagejs/
└── packages/
    ├── core/
    ├── client/
    ├── dashboard/
    ├── docs/
    └── examples/
```

Each subpackage has its own `package.json`, README, and optional tests.

---

### 💸 FUTURE MONETIZATION

* Hosted “MessageJS Cloud” with usage-based billing.
* Pro tiers (priority connectors, analytics, webhooks).
* Enterprise self-hosting support.

---

### 🧠 WHAT TO KEEP IN MIND

* Core should stay **framework-agnostic** (no frontend dependencies).
* SDK should be **lightweight** (<20KB gzipped).
* Connectors should be **pluggable**, so new platforms can be added easily.
* Everything should have **clear TypeScript types**.
* Docs and examples must stay **in sync** with the code.

### 🧩 TASK EXAMPLES (For AI agents)

When asked to “build”, “update”, or “generate code”, always:

1. Keep modular boundaries between `core`, `client`, and `dashboard`.
2. Write production-ready Node/TypeScript code.
3. Include helpful comments and usage examples.
4. Follow REST conventions and modern JS standards (ESM).
5. Write README updates if a feature changes.
